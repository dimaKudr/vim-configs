# Vim Configuration

vim-config created by Derek Wyatt was used as a base.
https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config

As I just started learning Vim, list of bundles used by Derek looks overwhelming to me. So I removed all of them except vim-scala. And will add some of them back in the future.

Included plugins:
* vim-airline (including patched fonts https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)
* vim-scala

Also I have added gvimrc separate config for gVim.

To install it, do the following:
* wipe out your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory (back up if you wish)
* `git clone https://github.com/dimaKudr/vim-configs.git ~/.vim`
* `cd ~/.vim/bundle && ./get`
* `ln ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* `ln ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc`
*  if you have ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file, hen add there content of just clonned ~/.vim/gtkrc-2.0. Otherwise configure a link `ln ~/.vim/gtkrc-2.0 ~/.gtkrc-2.0. This will rid off right and bottom gray bordrs in gVim fullscreen mode.
* start Vim

To update bundles (if necessary):
* `cd ~/.vim && ./update`

Note: Add to .bashrc following lines to enable 256 colors support in Terminal.
`if [ -n "$DISPLAY" -a "$TERM" == "xterm" ]; then
    export TERM=xterm-256color
fi`
